things to do when I rewrite my config 

1. make list of plugins/features I like and dislike
  what to keep vs what to not use

2. make sure startup is fast

3. separate plugins, keybinds etc in a neat and organized way

4. look into customization opportunities

5. Navigation of diagnostics and other things, maybe a hydra minor mode?

6. proper fold support


minor nitpicks:
1. when I close a tab, if the tab is open in another window, then close the buffer instead of the tab
2. word wrap instead of letter wrap (a word shouldn't get cut off due to wrapping)
