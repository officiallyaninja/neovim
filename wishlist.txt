things to do when I rewrite my config 

1. make list of plugins/features I like and dislike
  what to keep vs what to not use

2. make sure startup is fast

3. separate plugins, keybinds etc in a neat and organized way

4. look into customization opportunities

5. Navigation of diagnostics and other things, maybe a hydra minor mode?

6. proper fold support

7. try yazi

8. add numbers to taps so i can easily switch to them

9. disable highlighting word in insert mode and in oil

10. remove mini.move, unnecesaary in vim

minor nitpicks:
1. when I close a buffer, if the tab is open in another window, then close the window instead of the buffer
2. word wrap instead of letter wrap (a word shouldn't get cut off due to wrapping)
